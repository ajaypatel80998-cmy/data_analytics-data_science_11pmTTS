Suppose you want to display the top 3 trending songs from a 'songs' table based on play_count, but if two songs have the same play_count, the more recently added song should come first. Write the SQL query to achieve this.<br><br><em><strong>Hint:</strong> Use ORDER BY with multiple columns.</em>


```sql
SELECT *
FROM songs
ORDER BY play_count DESC, added_date DESC
LIMIT 3;
```
